# mysnakegame
This is the snake game I made during my 1st year of College.
It is made through Python
I made it with a combination of Tkinter and kivy
It is a classic snake game with 3 modes. This modes will vary based on what you choose.
The Boxes will randomly spawn everytime you eat the food or the point.
